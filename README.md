# Online Banking System
The objective of this project was to develop a secure and scalable online banking system that provides comprehensive banking functionalities. The system was designed to support various operations such as account management, fund transfers, transaction tracking, and user authentication, all while ensuring high security and performance standards.

*Technologies and Tools Used:
        * Java: Core programming language for backend development.
        * Spring Boot: Framework for building and running the application, simplifying dependency management and configuration.
        *  Hibernate: ORM tool for database interactions, simplifying data access and manipulation.
        * MySQL: Relational database for storing user, account, and transaction data.
        * RESTful APIs: Designed for communication between the frontend and backend services.
        * Swagger: For documenting and testing APIs, making it easier for frontend developers to understand and consume the APIs.
        * Postman: For API testing and validation.


* API Development: 
Designed and implemented RESTful APIs for various banking operations such as account creation, retrieving account details, deposits, withdrawals, fund transfers, and transaction history.

* Database Design: Created and optimized database schemas, ensuring efficient storage and retrieval of data. Utilized Hibernate for ORM to interact with the MySQL database.
  
* Exception Handling: Implemented comprehensive exception handling mechanisms to ensure the application handles errors gracefully and provides meaningful feedback to users.


Ensuring Code Quality and Scalability:
Code Reviews and Best Practices: Conducted regular code reviews to ensure adherence to coding standards and best practices. This helped in maintaining high code quality and facilitated knowledge sharing among team members.
Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD): Implemented a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins to automate testing and deployment processes. This ensured that only tested and approved code was deployed to production.
Documentation: Used Swagger for API documentation, making it easier for frontend developers to understand and consume the APIs. Maintained comprehensive project documentation for future reference and onboarding new team members.
Scalability: Designed the system with scalability in mind, using AWS services like Auto Scaling and load balancing. Ensured that the architecture could handle increasing traffic and data volume efficiently.
